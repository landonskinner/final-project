# unLeashed
This application was built using a React frontend with a Rails backend. The purpose of unLeashed is to serve as a dog "play dating" app that allows owners to find nearby companions for their own dogs. Upon entry into the application, the user is prompted to login to an existing account or to sign up. Once either action is completed, the user can begin swiping through other user profile cards by liking or disliking each user.

When two users mutually like one another, a match is created. On the Match page, the user can view their matches' profiles and start conversations with text and photo messaging.

Lastly, the Profile page gives the user the ability to view and edit their profile card.
